# Roadmap

Future features, design specs, and experimental work preserved from the legacy codebase. These live here as reference material and implementation blueprints.

## Origin

These documents and source files were extracted from:
- `docs/` — Edward's design docs and testing guides
- `src/experimental/` — In-progress R&D code (terrain generators, 3D components)

They were preserved during the CRA-to-monorepo migration to avoid losing work and design intent.
