// test_npc.js
// Run with: node test_npc.js

// We need to support ES modules or use current setup. 
// Since the project is using React scripts/webpack, running this directly with `node` 
// might fail if we use import/export syntax without "type": "module" in package.json or using .mjs extension.
// But let's check package.json first... user has "react-scripts".
// Just to be safe, I'll rely on the existing app structure or browser verification.
// Or I can instruct the user to run it via the app.

// actually, let's just make a temporary test page or component we can view.
// But even faster: I can inject a test into the DebugMenu or App.js content and just console.log it.

console.log("Please check the implementation plan. I will verify via the Debug Menu in the app.");
